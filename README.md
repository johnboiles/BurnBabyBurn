Tiny board for controlling a high-power logic-level n-channel MOSFET transistor. Useful for burning stuff (like nichrome wire). Useful as a timed cut-off for high-altitude ballooning.

Firmware
--------
Firmware is designed for the [Sparkfun Arduino Pro Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11098). It is extremely simple, and should be compatible with any arduino board.

PCB
---
The PCB is also designed for a [Sparkfun Arduino Pro Micro](https://www.sparkfun.com/products/11098), though I'm confident it could be used with a [Arduino Pro Mini](http://arduino.cc/en/Main/ArduinoBoardProMini).
